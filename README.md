STL Algorithms exercises

## Exercise 1

1. Create a sequence containing 1, 50, 3, 9, 18
1. Use `find_if` to locate the fist element divisible by 5

## Exercise 2

1. Create a string containing "algorithms are fun" 
1. Use `search` to locate the sub string "are" and print its starting position 

## Exercise 3

1. Create a sequence containing 1, 200, 5, 7, 900
2. Use `copy_if` to copy all elements >100 to another sequence
3. Use `copy` to the output stream to print the result

## Exercise 4

1. Create a sequnce containing 2,3,4,5
2. Use `transform` to double each value in the sequence and store in another sequnce
3. Print the result

## Exercise 5

1. Create a string containing "aaccdffgfgfgiili"
1. Use `sort`, `unique` and string `erase` to get "acdfgil"

## Exercise 6

1. Create a sequence containing 1,500,345,6,3,6
2. Use `stable_partition` to get 500,345,1,6,3,6

## Exercise 7

1. Create a sequence containing 1,500,345,6,3,6
2. Use `count_if` to calculate number of elements >100
